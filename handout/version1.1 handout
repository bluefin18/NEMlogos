The New Economy Movement is a community-driven effort to realize financial freedom, decentralization, and equality of opportunity, united in solidarity. 

To realize the goals of the movement, the NEM cryptocurrency consisting of the NIS (NEM Infrastructure Server) core and the NCC (NEM Community Client; aka, wallet) is being developed. When fully developed, the NEM platform will be one of the most advanced decentralized blockchains with a colored coin implementation (decentralized asset exchange). The source code is implemented from scratch in Java and Javacript (NCC). Innovations in blockchain server technology include Proof-of-Importance (POI), account rules, and Eigentrust++ peer reputation management. NCC has a distinct new wallet design that is completely different from Bitcoin QT-based wallets that almost all other coins are using. NCC design supports the innovative features in NIS and features robust security and a user friendly interface.

NIS and NCC completion will mark the launch of the NEM V1 blockchain. However, that will be just the beginning, as it is envisioned that the initiative will go full speed to build a dynamic NEM ecosystem as soon as NIS and NCC go live and pass an open beta. The NEM ecosystem team already includes dozens of developers. An incentive system is being put in place so that these developers stay motivated and help build the NEM environment. More importantly, there is a need to attract new developers by offering a coherent vision for the NEM technology roadmap that will show the community’s commitment to the NEM decentralized system over the long term. After launching the V1 blockchain, NEM core code will continue to be developed to add new features to support the growing NEM ecosystem.

The NEM community would like to invite you to take a part in the community’s initiative to develop the NEM system. The NEM development team core members currently are:

The NEM’s decentralized network needs to be nurtured by its community and it is encouraging to note that NEM’s community has about 3000 members. The NEM platform will draw its security from the community nodes’ support and continued expansion from community marketing efforts. In this aspect, you are invited to be a part of NEM’s effort and to join its community.

NEM will be created with a maximum of 4 billion units, divisible to 6 digits. 75% of that total is planned to be distributed to the community at the official launch, all with a minimum contribution towards promotional effort. Of the 75% of stakes to be given to the community, 71% have already been reserved to be handed out and the remaining 4% will be auctioned out. The proceeds shall be used for further development and to defray promotional and any other costs associated with the initiative. 25% will be reserved under control of the core development team, of which 10% is reserved to compensate the core development team for their work in fully developing NIS and NCC to the V1 blockchain specifications. 5% is reserved for the extended development team for their work on NEM promotion and the NEM ecosystem. The last 10% is reserved for future development after the completion of the V1 blockchain, including further development of the ecosystem and new features for the core blockchain.

A preliminary draft of the NEM development contract has already been released, in which the above distribution plan was officially written and agreed upon by all NEM initial community members. Until the final version of the NEM development contract is released, the stake distribution plan is subject to modifications and stakeholders can return them to the community at cost if they no longer wish to be a NEM contributor.

If you want to help build a new world economy order, you can consider becoming a part of the NEM community by acquiring a NEM stake from some other NEM community member who does not wish to be a member anymore at the NXT AE or during the auction that we will announce shortly. At the auction, each successful applicant shall be entitled to 1 million NEM coins upon NEM's official launch. 

It is important to note that the NEM is a project built by the community and for the community. NEM coins issued at almost close to nothing, are meant to kick start and proliferate the new economy movement. As this is a community, acquisition of these coins does not give rise to any equity nor profit that is to be generated. In fact there is no profit to be generated from this project. The project itself serves as a catalyst for anyone who wishes to make use of this platform thus created to establish their own projects. The value of these NEM coins shall be determined by the community and shall be used as the medium of exchange within the community.

As part of the community building, you are cordially invited to contribute to NEM's promotion and ecosystem-building effort. There is no monetary award other than just the NEM coins  that are reserved for these activities. Most of all, it is hoped that you will be a long-term supporter of NEM in the building of the network security and spreading the word about NEM’s efforts to transform the world’s economu. Together, the community can break free from nation-state centralization, corrupted by political power, and build a new economy based on the principles of financial freedom, decentralization, and grassroot contributions. In solidarity.
